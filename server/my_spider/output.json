This part is located at the back of the fridge, beneath the bottom panel. It is connected directly to 2 water supplies, a wiring harness, and your inlet water tube. Minerals and sediments can build up over time and cause a blockage in your inlet valve.  They can also cause the valve to stick open, leading to an overflow of water. If this part is malfunctioning, water flow to your appliance could be compromised. Check for small ice cubes or a lack of ice cubes/water, as this is an obvious sign the part is damaged. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. Test your water inlet valve with a multimeter. You can test both the water dispenser side and the ice maker side. The part measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.75 inches wide and is constructed of plastic and metal. This replacement part features 1 dual inlet water valve with quick connections. It also has 1/4 and 5/16 John Guest fittings for the outlet lines and a 1/4 compression fitting for the inlet line.",

      "description": "This OEM ice and water filter fits side-by-side and bottom-freezer GE models. The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.",

This ice maker is a complete assembly; the whole assembly attaches to the wall of your freezer. ***NOTE: Ice maker does NOT come with the bail or shut off arm.

      "description": "This refrigerator door shelf bin, also known as the door bin, or sometimes just a \"bucket\", is an authentic manufacturer-certified part made of white plastic and is easy to install. It is used to hold items in the fridge door, like jars, cans, and bottles, and you'll be able to visually see if the part is broken or warped. This particular shelf attaches directly to the fridge door; you should be able to pull out the old bin and snap the new one into place by observing the slots and pushing the bin down into them. You can check if this model is right for your appliance by checking your user manual and model number.  The door bin measures about 18 inches wide, 4.5 inches high, by 7 inches deep. This door shelf bin is sold individually, so if your refrigerator takes multiple bins, which many do, you will need to order the appropriate amount of bins.",

If your water inlet valve is malfunctioning, you could be getting a lack of water to the inside of your refrigerator. Your ice maker may not produce cubes or your water dispenser may not work. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. This valve measures approximately 7 inches long and 4.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in blue, and includes the valve and mounting bracket.",

It is specially designed to secure the mullion in refrigerators, allowing it to pivot and ensure smooth door movement. The mullion acts as a barrier between the refrigerator and freezer to maintain the desired temperatures for each section. A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.",

This white, OEM part measures roughly 1 inch in diameter and can be used for the front and the rear support, as designed by the manufacturer, and mounts to the inside cabinet wall. Replacing this part is an easy repair, and will require a small flat blade screwdriver, a putty knife, and a soft hammer. Remove the crisper and shelf from the refrigerator before replacing the support. The crisper cover front support is held in place with a locking pin. To remove the old part, you will first need to push the pin into the interior of the cabinet using the screwdriver, and then you can pull the support out with a putty knife. If you cannot get the pin out you can use a flat-blade screwdriver to push it down and out of sight and it will not harm anything in your refrigerator After removing the pin and attaching the new support, simply use the soft hammer to lock the new pin in place.",

      "description": "This is an OEM replacement ice and water filter for your refrigerator. In side-by-side refrigerators, it is found in the top right corner or the bottom left grille. In bottom-freezer refrigerators, the filter is in the bottom left grille. In top-freezer units, the filter is located in the middle of the refrigerator. This NSF certified filter reduces 28 contaminants including pharmaceuticals, metals, minerals, pesticides, cysts, industrial chemicals, Class I Particulates and chlorine. It is made up of coconut carbon block and has three layers of filtration. The first layer is particle filtration that helps block larger contaminants. The second layer is micro-filtration, which prevents medium-sized impurities from passing. The third layer is called absorption filtration, which absorbs microscopic-sized pollutants. It measures 2 inches deep, 2 inches wide, 1-1/2 inches high, and weighs 0.5 lbs. To ensure your filter is working its best, it needs to be replaced every six months. This single filter has a simple, quick-turn installation feature that does not require any tools.",

If a broken arm assembly is not replaced, your dishes may still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. Additionally, leftover food residue can result in an unpleasant smell within the dishwasher. To remove the existing arm assembly, simply grasp the center of it and lift it up so that it unsnaps from your dishwasher. Please note that this OEM-sourced part is sold individually.",

If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.",

If your dishes are not drying or the water in the dishwasher is not getting hot you may need to replace the element. This kit includes the heater, two heater fasteners, and is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power before starting the repair. Use a multi-meter to test your heating element for continuity to determine whether this is the part that is causing your symptom. This part does not include any washers. To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part.

If you have a broken or faulty door latch, your dishwasher door may not stay closed, and this can prevent the dishwasher from running. This item is sold individually, and if your door strike is also damaged, you will need to replace that part separately. This is an OEM part sourced directly from the manufacturer.",

If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.",

      "description": "This is a drain pump assembly for various compatible models of dishwashers, that is responsible for draining the water from the dishwasher after every cycle. This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.",

Its primary function is to catch and trap small particles of food, debris, and other contaminants that may be present in the water circulating inside the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. This filter helps prevent these particles from clogging the pump or recirculating back onto the dishes. Signs of a faulty micro filter include poor cleaning performance, slow drainage, stagnant water at the bottom of the tub, and loud and unusual noises when the dishwasher is running. It is recommended to clean the filter once a month for optimal performance.",

The drain hose connects to the pump located below the lower spray arm and aids in proper dishwasher drainage. This white and black plastic hose is 7.5 feet long. For this repair, you will need either a 1/4-inch or 5/16-inch nut driver, depending on your model. You will need to remove the lower access panel on your dishwasher to complete this repair; it is often easier to remove the dishwasher from the cabinet to do so. Be sure to disconnect the dishwasher from both the power and water supply before completing this repair.",

Check the spring on the opposite side of the dishwasher door, they often wear at the same rate so you may want to replace both springs for exact tension on either side. No tools are required for this repair. This is an OEM replacement part.",

The strike is mounted on the body of the dryer, while the catch is mounted on the dryer door. These two parts work together to keep your dryer door closed. The catch holds the door strike to keep the door closed during the drying cycle. If the door does not latch closed, you won’t be able to start a drying cycle. If this part is malfunctioning, you may not be able to open or close your door. In some instances, it may seem like your door is closing, but if it is not latching properly you won’t be able to start your drying cycle. You should replace this part as soon as it’s malfunctioning. Your dryer may run even though the latch is malfunctioning, but it is unsafe if the dryer continues to run while the door is open. This replacement part features 1 door latch kit which includes 2 strikes, 3 catches, and a set of instructions. This model is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white/silver.",

If you find the dish rack is causing the door to not close properly, it may be due to the part being worn out or damaged. All you need to complete this repair is a small flat blade screw driver. Simply pop out the cap with a smaller flat-blade screwdriver and snap the new one into place. If the rear cap needs to be replaced you will need to remove both front caps and slide the rack completely off for full access. It is important to note that this part is sold individually, and more than one may be required, depending on your repair. An inexpensive part, it can be a good idea to purchase several at a time to have on-hand when needed.",

To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in.

The nozzle assembly can be found at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is responsible for spraying water onto the dishes and utensils inside the dishwasher using a series of nozzles that release pressure water. Over time, the sprayer head may become clogged due to a build of debris and soap residue, or it may also be damaged by a falling item. If the sprayer head is faulty, you will likely notice that your dishes are not cleaned properly after a cycle, and they have spots of leftover soap residue. It is important to replace the sprayer head to keep your dishwasher running efficiently.",

A flat blade screw driver is the only tool needed for this installation. Open the lower dishwasher rack and remove retaining tabs from both ends of the rack and slide it out. Locate the older roll assembly, remove it and replace the rollers. Remember to put the tabs on each side back before sliding it back in.

It is a rubber seal that helps prevent water from leaking out of the dishwasher during the wash cycle. It also helps to absorb the noise and vibrations created while the dishwasher is running. Over time the gasket may wear down, tear, or fall off due to exposure to heat and chemicals. If the gasket can no longer create a watertight seal, it is best to replace it promptly to keep your dishwasher running efficiently and to prevent potential accidents.",

      "description": "A faucet adapter coupling allows the user to connect their dishwasher to their kitchen faucet, and this coupling acts as a bridge between the faucet and intake hose for its various compatible dishwashers. This coupling features a plastic end with a mainly metal construction and a threaded section near that plastic end to screw into the faucet, whereas the other end connects to an intake hose that feeds into the dishwasher. This faucet adapter coupling is sold as an individual OEM part without any other hoses or connectors but does come with smaller components inside, such as O-rings and a spout adapter. If you notice water leaking from the connector area of this adapter on your dishwasher, it is likely that the adapter has some form of O-ring deterioration, thread wear, or mineral buildup and needs to be replaced. To replace this adapter, make sure your dishwasher and sink are off, and then simply thread this adapter onto the end of your faucet and connect the non-threaded end into the hose.",

      "description": "This screw-type clamp, also known as a hose clamp, is made of metal and is used within various models of washers to secure the tub-to-pump hose and tub/drum of the washer. Without this clamp, the hose is vulnerable to leaking and disconnecting from the tub during the wash cycle of the washer, which can present a serious safety hazard for the machine and your home. Clamps can wear out and lose their tension due to excessive vibrations, mechanical damage, and normal wear and tear, all things present within a washing machine. To replace this clamp, you will first need to turn off your washer and you will need access to the lower portion of the washer chassis, which may require one or multiple screwdrivers and wrenches. Once you have access, use your screwdriver to loosen this clamp, which can then be removed and replaced with the new clamp, which will need to be tightened securely. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the washer you originally disassembled.",

      "description": "When the igniter reaches a high enough temperature, these coils (Coil Valve, Dryer Gas Valve Coil Kit, Dryer Valve Coil Kit, Gas Valve Solenoid) work together to open the gas valve and allow the gas to enter the burner. This is a safety mechanism to ensure that there are no unsafe buildups of gas inside your appliance. The coils are attached to the dryer gas valve. If the dryer does not heat or heats intermittently, the coil may not be opening the gas valve. Both coils must be operational for the valve to open. No continuity would indicate a defective coil, but they can be intermittent and fail when they get hot. Both coils should be replaced when one of them is broken. This part can break as a result of material fatigue from normal use. This part measures approximately 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch in height, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/beige. This part features a 3-terminal boost/hold coil and a 2-terminal secondary coil",

The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.",

      "description": "This dishwasher door gasket (Bottom Gasket, Gasket, Door Seal, Dishwasher Door Lower Seal) helps prevent water from leaking out of the bottom edge of your dishwasher door by creating a watertight seal. This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.",

It is responsible for circulating water throughout the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. The circulation pump draws water from the dishwasher tub, pressurizes it, and then distributes it to the spray arms, which spray the water onto the dishes to remove food particles and debris. The circulation pump may fail due to several reasons such as an electrical fault, a blockage in the pump impeller, motor failure, or physical damage. A faulty pump will result in water leakages, unusually loud noises during use, reduced water circulation, and poor cleaning performance.",

Replacing this panel will requires some disassembly of your dishwasher, and will require tools like a screwdriver, wrench, and a pair of pliers. This OEM user interface panel measures approximately 14-inches wide and is sold individually.",

The defrost timer acts as a clock, that switches the refrigerator from the freezing cycle to the defrost cycle and back. If your refrigerator is running non-stop, or is not running at all, you may need to check and replace the defrost timer. This is a 6 hour and 21 minute defrost timer. This part is made of white plastic, with 4 metal prongs protruding from one end. To complete this repair, you will need to access the old defrost timer which is located inside the console on the roof of your refrigerator. To complete this repair, you will need a 1/4-inch nut driver, a flat blade screwdriver, and a Phillips screwdriver. Be sure to disconnect power from your refrigerator before you begin this repair.",

If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced.

This kit also has a metal compression ring that secures the fan to the evaporator. The evaporator mechanism is normally located in the freezer and is responsible for pulling the warmer air over the condenser coils, cooling it off and then blowing and circulating that cooler air through the rest of the refrigerator. If the freezer compartment has a frost buildup or if there is a lack of cooling and airflow in your refrigerator, this fan likely needs to be replaced. To replace your evaporator fan, you will likely need a screwdriver and a set of pliers and check your user manual for the exact location of your evaporator fan.",

It can be located in either the freezer compartment near the evaporator coils or in the fresh food compartment near the airflow channels, depending on the model. If you notice issues like excessive icing in the freezer, inadequate cooling in the refrigerator, temperature fluctuations, or error messages on the display panel, it indicates a potential problem with the thermistor. Since your fridge will not be able to maintain the desired temperature, this results in food spoilage, inefficient cooling, and potential damage to the cooling components. To replace the thermistor, disconnect it from the connector plug or wiring harness and remove any mounting brackets or clips using a screwdriver if necessary. Remember to consult your user manual to determine the required number of thermistors, as they are sold individually as OEM replacement parts.",

Wear work gloves to protect your hands. The thermistor itself, part WPW10383615, should test at these Ohms depending on temperature. It's recommended to test at room temperature and again in a glass of ice water to make sure it's sensing temperatures properly. So it should read around 3000 - 5000 Ohms at room temperature 7000 - 10000 Ohms at 0°C and 20000 Ohms at -15°C.",

The second is to provide physical filtration. This means trapping moisture, small metal chips, and dirt found in the refrigerant gas. If your refrigerator motor is constantly running, but the refrigerator is not getting cold, the issue could be due to a damaged or faulty filter-drier. Faulty filter-driers are sometimes the cause for abnormal freezer compartment temperatures and partially frosted evaporators. This filter-drier is approximately 11 inches long. Remember to disconnect the power from your refrigerator before beginning this repair.",

If your key will not lock, or unlock the freezer door, check to see if it has been bent or damaged. If the key is damaged, you should look to replace it to avoid damaging the lock. The key should engage the locking mechanism with ease. If the lock sticks when you turn the key, penetrating fluid should be used to loosen the mechanism. These keys are sold separately, and should be stored somewhere safe and not next to the unit.",

When you push the button, a valve is activated inside the refrigerator, which releases water from the internal water supply. If the button is faulty, you will also likely notice that the dispenser can not release any water, or that it does so inconsistently. Over time the button may fail due to aging or due to accidental damage. You will need to replace the button if it is unresponsive when you push it, or if it seems stuck.",

There will be one adjustable foot found in the package. Lift the dryer and place the wood to keep it propped up. You may need to use the pliers to remove the old foot. Screw the new foot into place using your hand. Once the new leveling foot is in place, lift the appliance and remove the block. Test the machine out to ensure it is now sitting level.",

The evaporator drip tray sits below the evaporator to collect dripping water. If the drip tray is damaged, you may notice that your refrigerator is leaking. Because it is made of plastic, the drip tray can eventually develop a crack. You will need to pull out the refrigerator from the wall, and take off the bottom panel on the back of your refrigerator in order to access the drip tray for replacement. This is an OEM part sourced directly from the manufacturer.",

It acts as a barrier between the contents of the drawer and the external environment of the refrigerator. It protects the contents of the crisper drawer from debris, odors, and other contaminants that may be present. The front panel also helps to control the amount of airflow and humidity within the drawer, helping to keep fruits and vegetables fresh longer. It also contributes to the overall appearance of the refrigerator, providing a finished look to the crisper drawer. If the front panel is damaged, it may become difficult to slide the crisper drawer back and forth and the freshness of the food may be compromised.",

      "description": "This is cookware designed for use in your range or oven. It is a two-piece dish that is used to grill or cook food while the broil function is on, meaning it can withstand high temperatures. This set includes both the pan and the grid. The grid is the top part. The slotted design allows grease to easily drip into to the pan below. Not only does it catch all of the drippings, it also prevents splatter and smoke while cooking. The pan can also be used separately for baking and roasting. This cookware features a durable porcelain finish, which means it is incredibly easy to clean, and is dishwasher safe. It is roughly 1.5 inches deep, and measures approximately 16.5 inches by 12.5 inches. If your two-piece broil plan is lost, rusted, or damaged this is the replacement you need.",

      "description": "This heavy-duty cord has a three-pronged plug (2 electrical, 1 grounding). The power cord supplies power to your refrigerator, allowing it to keep the contents inside cool. There could be an issue with your cord if you notice that the refrigerator will not turn on, or intermittently turns on and off. Check the cord for fraying, or other visible damage. If the power cord shows any signs of damage, replace the cord immediately as it could become an electrical or fire hazard. Before you begin this repair, ensure that the power is disconnected from the unit, and that all food that could ruin is stored away while the power is off.",

Over time the shelf can break, bend, or become warped, due to age or excessive weight. It is important not to overload your shelf as this can lead to premature failure. Replacing the shelf is a simple repair that does not require specialized tools. To remove the old shelf, simply lift it upward to disengage it from the support brackets and pull it out of the refrigerator. Position the new wire shelf on the brackets and ensure it is well aligned.",

If you notice that your doors open and the mullion either moves freely or is stuck, this hinge needs to be replaced immediately to prevent issues with frost buildup, energy efficiency and temperature fluctuations. Replacing this hinge is quite simple, and you will only need a flathead and Philips-head screwdriver to do it. First, remove the screw covers from the securing screws for the mullion. Unscrew and remove the securing screws with your Philips-head screwdriver, and then pull the mullion up and out carefully to dislodge it from the fridge door. Near the middle of the mullion, disconnect the wire harness to remove the mullion completely. Remove the hinge cover with a flathead screwdriver to expose the hinge, and then carefully remove and replace the old hinge onto its attaching spring. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the door assembly, along with the hinge cover and wire harness.",

It is 2 inches deep, 6 inches high, 2.25 inches wide and weighs approximately 1 lbs. When it comes time to replace the filter, first discard the old one by turning it to the left to remove. It will release itself when it has been turned far enough. \n\nInstallation instructions are quick and simple but can vary slightly depending on if it is a bottom-freezer, side-by-side or multi-door bottom-freezer model. Refer to the user instructions for you filter. Do not forget to reset the filter change indicator if applicable. In bottom-freezer and side-by-side models this is done by pressing and holding the RESET WATER FILTER bottom for three seconds. On a multi-door bottom-freezer model, press the button underneath the Confirm Filter Change message while the water is dispensing. On select models this reset is done automatically once a new filter is installed.",

If the end caps of your refrigerator or freezer are broken or cracked, or if your food retainer bar is not staying in place, then replacing the door support can solve this problem. No tools are needed for this repair project. To repair, first remove the end cap by pushing upward or downwards to slide it out the end of the rail. Next, replace with new end cap and line it up to clip it back onto the rail. It comes in white and measures about two inches high. Remember to wear gloves for safety.",

      "description": "This door gasket, also known as a door seal, is sourced from the original equipment manufacturer for use in refrigerators and freezers. It is a flexible rubber strip that runs along the edge of the appliance door. It creates an airtight seal between the door and cabinet to prevent cold air from escaping, and warm air from entering the refrigerator, to ensure that the temperature in the appliance remains constant. Over time, the door gasket can lose its elasticity or tear. In this case, you will likely notice frost build-up, increased noise, and inconsistent temperatures. Peel the faulty gasket off the refrigerator frame and remove any debris or residue on the surface. Carefully place the new seal along the edge of the door and press it firmly into place. Secure it with the appropriate fasteners and close the door to verify that there are no gaps between the door and cabinet.",

When the refrigerator needs to cool down, the damper receives signals from the thermostat or control board to open and allows more cold air from the freezer to enter the refrigerator compartment. When the desired temperature is reached, the damper closes to restrict airflow. If the damper assembly is faulty or damaged, your fridge will be unable to maintain the desired temperature levels.

      "description": "This evaporator fan motor circulates air to the fresh food compartments for efficient cooling. It powers the evaporator fan that draws air from the refrigerator and circulates it over the evaporator coils. Your fan motor has a long life cycle, but can burn out quickly if there is an obstruction preventing the fan from rotating.  If the fan does not operate, the freezer will not cool properly. This will affect the performance of the compressor. This evaporator fan motor is located in the back of the freezer section of your refrigerator, behind the auger motor assembly. It is attached to the back wall. If you notice problems with your freezer then check to see if there is anything blocking a fan blade. If there is no obstruction, test the evaporator fan motor using a multimeter. Test the 2 wires that travel from the coil on the motor for resistance. If these tests indicate that the evaporator fan motor is at fault, it must be replaced. This part features 1 evaporator fan motor, which is metal and plastic, and comes in white/silver",

      "description": "The evaporator fan motor (Motor Evaporator Fan, Evaporator Fan Motor Kit, Evaporator Fan Motor, Refrigerator Evaporator Fan Motor) circulates air through the food compartment for efficient cooling in refrigerators. The evaporator fan motor can squeal as its bearing dries out. The motor bearings can totally seize, preventing any movement. The motor coil can also burn out, preventing any fan movement. If this motor fails, the refrigerator compartment will warm up and eventually the freezer will reduce cooling as well. Excessive frost can build up on the evaporator coil due to lack of air movement. The motor can make a squealing noise when it is beginning to fail or will not operate at all when powered, and this is a sign it should be replaced. The evaporator is located in the rear of the freezer compartment. This part measures 2-1/2 inches wide by 3 inches tall by 1 inch thick, at its widest point. It is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/silver. This kit includes the evaporator fan motor and harness.",

If your door flapper is broken, it could allow outside air to enter the freezer and alter the inside temperature. You may notice frost buildup surrounding the dispenser area. The door flap can disconnect from the dispenser lever, or the tabs that hold it in place may break. Frequent use may distort the sealing face and cause air leaks and frost buildup.

It is typically located at the back of the refrigerator, where it runs from the water inlet valve to the ice maker assembly. When the ice maker needs to produce ice, water flows through this tube and fills the ice maker tray, where it freezes into ice cubes. The fill tube is an essential component of the ice maker system, ensuring a steady supply of water for ice production. If the fill tube becomes clogged or damaged, it can water leaks inside the refrigerator and also lead to difficulties producing ice when needed.",
